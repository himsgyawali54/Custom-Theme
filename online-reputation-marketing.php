                    Online reputation marketing is similar to managing your
                    brands most effectively online. It refers to how you
                    overlook every detail about your brand once it's presented
                    online. Since everything has become digital and people have
                    started to search for everything online before purchasing,
                    online reputation marketing plays a key role. Managing your
                    brand's online reputation isn't done at once, but investing
                    yourself in it as soon as possible can save you and your
                    brand reputation from potential threats in the future.

                    Knowing The Difference Between Reputation Marketing and
                    Reputation Management

                  <p>
                    Everyone has heard about both terms reputation marketing and
                    reputation management. People tend to get very confused
                    between these two terms. It is important to understand
                    reputation management before diving into reputation
                    marketing and knowing the differences between these two.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Reputation management is about how to manage the way the
                    audience views your brand and manage it accordingly.
                    Whereas, reputation marketing is about the way you promote
                    and showcase your brand so that it attracts the audience
                    hoping that the way they view the image of your brand is
                    reliable. Online Reputation management can include things
                    like managing reviews, solving customer or audience issues,
                    or providing feedback. It is about shaping the perception of
                    your audience. Google alerts, and managing negative reviews
                    are some examples of online reputation management.
                    Reputation marketing is about the way you get good reviews
                    and feedback from customers. You can also use this positive
                    review as online marketing content for your brand.
                    Reputation marketing services also apply Search Engine
                    Optimization SEO, content marketing tactics, social media
                    campaigns, and improving the visibility of the queries are
                    some examples of reputation marketing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, both reputation management and marketing go hand in
                    hand as it focuses on building and managing the overall
                    image of the company/brand. One cannot work without the
                    other one. If you're able to go with a good online

                    then, there might not be any benefit of reputation
                    management but knowing about it is a must as you could be
                    dealing with some unexpected problems or situations in the
                    future.

                    As mentioned before, everyone searches for a product or

                    visible for those who look forward to purchasing it. This
                    builds up the confidence of the new customers and increases
                    sales. This also builds the reputation of your brand. You
                    can also ask for positive reviews from your customers. But
                    do not force them. You must also learn to respond to
                    negative reviews instead of ignoring them. Responding to a
                    negative comment in a positive way may save the chances of
