                  <h1>How to Outlast a Google Core Update and Achieve Top Rankings?</h1>
                  <p>Do you ever wonder why some businesses seem to always rank at the top of Google search results? Well, even if you're not an SEO expert or marketer, it's pretty widely known that Google has made huge strides since it first launched way back in 1998. And with every core update, the search engine gets even smarter, which means that having a solid understanding of SEO is more important than ever if you want your business to stand out in the digital age. So if you're looking to improve your online presence, it might be time to start brushing up on your SEO skills!</p>
                  <p>Google updates are a regular occurrence, and on occasion, websites may suffer the consequences. Even though your website is technically sound, a drop in rankings and traffic can still occur. One example of an update where this can happen is a core algorithm update. While acknowledging that regular core updates are an inevitable aspect of digital existence is important, being able to adjust to them successfully is a different matter entirely. This article provides an in-depth examination of all the essential information you need to remain ahead of the curve.</p>
                  <h2 id="what-is-a-google-core-update">What is a Google Core Update?</h2>
                  <p>In contrast to other releases, a Google core update brings about extensive and far-reaching modifications to the organization's search algorithm and systems. Although most rollouts go unnoticed, core updates garner attention as they have a noticeable impact on search outcomes.</p>
                 <p>Google conducts core updates to its search engine algorithm and systems, which involve significant and extensive changes. The main objective of these updates is to enhance the search experience for users by providing them with more pertinent, valuable, and dependable content. These updates occur multiple times every year, and Google confirms their implementation.</p>
                 <h2 id="how-often-does-google-update">How Often Does Google Update?</h2>
                 <p>Although there is no precise information on how frequently Google conducts updates, experts believe that minor search algorithm adjustments take place roughly 500 to 600 times per year, which means they occur a couple of times daily, on average. Major core updates by Google are less frequent, happening once every two or three months. To stay up-to-date with Google's update schedule, individuals can check their website, where they regularly provide comprehensive explanations of each named core update.</p>

                <p>In the past, some significant core updates have taken place, such as Penguin, Panda, Hummingbird, Fred, and Possum.</p>
                <h2 id="how-does-a-google-core-update-affect-your-seo-strategies">How does a Google Core Update affect your SEO strategies?</h2>
                <p>For most website owners, a Google core update is a significant event because it can significantly impact their prior SEO strategies. SEO is typically a long-term process that may take weeks or even months to attain high rankings in search engine results pages (SERPs) for crucial web pages. However, Google core updates bring about substantial modifications to the algorithm, which can have a significant effect on search engine rankings.</p>

                <p>Some core updates by Google, such as the 2011 Google Panda update, led to such significant algorithm changes that webmasters had to entirely alter their strategies. Before the Panda update, websites could rank highly with limited content that didn't have to be very substantial. However, the Panda update imposed a penalty on sites that relied on this type of content approach. Ultimately, the Panda update improved the quality of content on the web and made Google a more effective search engine. Nonetheless, it also presented significant challenges for content creators and web administrators to reassess their conventional SEO practices and make improvements.</p>

                <p>Almost every Google core update is bound to have an impact on a considerable number of websites. However, it's not all doom and gloom if your site is one of them. There are methods to recuperate from the effects of the update, as well as to better prepare for future updates. Here are some key points to remember:</p>
                <h3 id="improve-the-quality-of-your-content">1. Improve the quality of your content</h3>
                <p>Although Google suggests that there is no specific action to take following a core update, they frequently recommend enhancing website content as a means to improve a website. Here are some general queries to consider when assessing your website content:</p>
                <h4>What is the level of trustworthiness conveyed by your website?</h4>
                <p>It's important to make sure your website has a modern appearance with updated content, and a good user experience. Incorporating testimonials, client logos, and statistics on pages with high bounce rates is a great way to establish "curb appeal" trust. Keep in mind that this strategy should not only be reserved for your About Us page. Visitors need to feel confident and trust your business.</p>
                <h4>Is the content produced by an expert or an enthusiast with deep knowledge of the subject matter?</h4>
                <p>You should provide visitors with accurate information that goes beyond what other sites offer. Don't just present the facts; explain the reasoning behind them. Demonstrate wisdom, not just knowledge.</p>

                <p>There are further steps you can take beyond the previous recommendations. It's crucial to conduct a detailed analysis of your webpages and evaluate the characteristics that contribute to a high-quality resource.</p>
                
                <p>To make a webpage a high-quality resource, there are various elements to consider, including experience, expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness (<a href="what-is-google-eeat-and-why-is-it-important-for-seo">E-E-A-T</a>) approach, journalistic integrity, content optimization, technical SEO, original data, searchable keywords, defining ambiguous terms, shareable content, and SEO siloing for subject relevance and authority to enhance the user experience.</p>
                <h3 id="silo-the-site">2. Silo the site</h3>
                <p>To create a silo structure means to organize the content on your website by grouping and linking pages together that are related to a specific topic, resulting in distinct and organized sections of content. It enables a website to establish its credibility and proficiency in a particular subject by delivering comprehensive responses through numerous pages of high-quality content related to that topic.</p>

                <p>By grouping and interlinking content on a specific topic, SEO siloing enhances a website's relevance to search engines. This method also helps establish the website as an authority and expert on a subject matter. Additionally, it facilitates navigation of the site, making it easy for both search engines and visitors to locate content.</p>
                
                <p>The following is an approximate representation of how SEO silos are implemented in real-world scenarios:</p>
                
              <img
                src="./img/silo-structure-in-seo.webp"
                alt="Silo structure in SEO"
              />
              <p class="text-center mb-5"><b>Silo structure in SEO</b></p>
              <p>Each silo in SEO structure comprises a primary page and associated content, all interconnected. However, it is essential to note that the content of one silo does not link to the content of another silo. This is why it is called a silo structure since the content is effectively separated into silos.</p>

                <p>Developing comprehensive content within each silo, structured in this manner, offers two significant benefits:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provides an exceptional user experience, as the content is effortless to locate and navigate. This can lead to increased website engagement and user retention.</li> 
                        <li>Facilitates search engines in determining relevance, which enhances the website's positioning for ranking relevant keywords.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h3 id="handle-internal-linking">3. Handle internal linking</h3>
                    <p>Effective internal linking is a critical aspect of SEO, with benefits for both users and search engines. A well-executed internal link strategy can make it easier for users to find relevant content on your website and communicate to search engines the primary topics covered on your site. Moreover, by enabling search engines to explore more pages on your website, your site's visibility in search results can increase. Additionally, linking web pages within your site can pass on link equity from one page to another, which can boost the overall authority of your site. Therefore, developing a well-structured internal link strategy is essential for maximizing the SEO potential of your website.</p>
                    
                    <p>Internal links can take various forms, such as main navigation, contextual links, related content links, and footer links. While it is apparent to link from a blog, it is crucial to ensure that all pages added to the website are also part of the internal linking strategy. In other words, every page on the site should be considered when implementing the linking strategy.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="obtain-seo-audit">4. Obtain an SEO audit</h4>
                    <p>An SEO audit is a systematic process that involves evaluating the effectiveness of your website's optimization for search engines. Undertaking an SEO audit can assist you in devising a strategy that can help your website match or exceed your competition. However, it's important to note that many SEO audits only focus on identifying and fixing existing issues. This type of SEO audit is prevalent because many websites require significant improvements. It's relatively easy for an SEO expert or agency to scan through a website and pinpoint the areas that require repair. After fixing these issues, the site is likely to perform better and achieve better search engine rankings which shows the <a href="why-seo-is-important-for-business">importance of SEO</a> for various businesses.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, the process of being rewarded for fixing website issues can change abruptly, for instance, due to a core update. When such shifts occur, it becomes necessary to execute the right optimization techniques better than your competitors, making sure your website is at least less imperfect than theirs. That is why it's crucial to have an SEO audit that focuses on enhancing competitiveness, ensuring that your website can withstand core updates and other necessary improvements.</p>
                    <h3 id="be-prepared-for-future-core-updates">5. Be prepared for future core updates</h3>
                    <p>In the realm of SEO, it's highly likely that the upcoming Google core update is right around the corner. To prepare for future core updates, taking proactive measures can go a long way. In addition to consistently producing high-quality and user-friendly content, diversifying your traffic sources and income streams can help reduce your dependence on Google's organic traffic and ad revenue from your site, respectively. Developing a strong brand that doesn't rely solely on search engines to attract new leads and cultivating a loyal audience that can be engaged through various channels, including social media and email, are also critical steps towards preparedness. By taking these steps, you can ensure that your website is equipped to handle future changes and maintain its relevance and success in the long run.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>While there are no certainties that a core update won't affect your website, it's possible to prepare for it. Losing organic traffic after a core update can be scary, but it's possible to recover. It's important to prepare your website for potential changes to avoid negative impacts in the future.You can seek assistance from an <a href="/">SEO agency</a> to improve your SEO efforts.
